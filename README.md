# 🖥️ Windows-Based C++ Compiler Tool

A feature-rich C++ compiler tool built for Windows, designed to help understand the inner workings of compilers. This tool functions as a **lexer**, **tokenizer**, **syntax checker**, and **syntax tree builder**, enabling users to explore and analyze C++ source code with ease.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 **Lexer & Tokenizer**  
  Efficiently breaks down source code into meaningful tokens for analysis.

- 🔹 **Syntax Checker**  
  Verifies expressions and statements for syntax errors with clarity and precision.

- 🔹 **Syntax Tree Builder**  
  Constructs and visualizes syntax trees to support deeper understanding of code structure and logic.

## ⚙️ Compiler Workflow

Understand the complete flow of a compiler, including:
- Source file input
- Lexical and syntax analysis
- Token generation
- Error handling
- User interaction and actionable feedback
